As an individual of color that presides in the United States of America, it is difficult not to be aware of the very prevalent issues of cultural appropriation in today’s society, especially in fashion and pop culture. This project, Culture Not Costume, is based upon identifying the appropriation of traditional Native American headdresses, an act that has persisted and continues to persist in the fashion industry.

The slogan “Culture Not Costume” was chosen because it is short, easy to remember, and easy to understand. Paired with a legible bold typeface, casual browsers are able to quickly grasp the concept behind these posters.
