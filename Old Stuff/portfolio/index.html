        <h1>Culture Not Costume</h1>
        <img src="images/portfolio/culturestack.svg">
        <p>As an individual of color that presides in the United States of America, it is difficult not to be aware of the very prevalent issues of cultural appropriation in today’s society, especially in fashion and pop culture. This project, Culture Not Costume, is based upon identifying the appropriation of traditional Native American headdresses, an act that has persisted and continues to persist in the fashion industry.</p>

        <h1>A Dance with Color</h1>
        <p>I have always enjoyed drawing people and creating unique pieces of clothing for them. For this project, I designed the figure with a party theme in mind, hence the flouncy cocktail dress, the long flowing hair, and the energetic balloons in the background.</p>
        <p>The four color schemes that this project studies are complementary, triadic, analogous, and compound, each color scheme aiming to bring out a different aspect of the design. </p>

        <h1>Alpha Phi Omega Spring 2019 Rush Shirt</h1>
        <p>Subtlety was the main goal behind this shirt design. After two years of being a part of Alpha Phi Omega, it was noticeable that some active members prefer less flashy designs. Thus, I created a design that represented Alpha Phi Omega’s values and principles while also catering to those that prefer a shirt design that they could casually wear around.</p>

        <p>This logo was designed for a client named Lily. It was used on her YouTube channel (although inactive) as a profile and trademark. </p>

        <h1>Rainboba</h1>
        <p>The original purpose of this project was to create stickers for my university organization, Alpha Phi Omega, in order to fundraise for our chapter. I chose boba tea as the subject of this design as it is a very trendy and popular drink among college students.</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img>
        <p>From a young age, bright colors have always fascinated me. I was an imaginative child that longed for pastel pink instead of the boring white that covered my bedroom walls and I dreamt of rainbows. Coloring was my favorite hobby and arts and crafts was always my favorite part of school. From the macaroni crafts to the chunky snowflakes that my parents proudly stuck on the fridge, my childhood self was obsessed with creating.</p>
        <p>Today, my love for creating has multiplied. Today, I am a designer that is passionate about graphic design. I believe that design is a integral part of all things in life; furniture is design, architecture is design, clothing is design, everything is the way it is because of the way that it was designed. My particular interest in design lies in the way that we can communicate complex ideas through simple aesthetics. Design is the outlet through which I express my love for creating and my work captures the essence of my identity while also maintaining a flexibility that molds to client needs.</p>
